# Tweet_Sentiment_Classification


In this project the tweets about coronavirus are analysed, with the goal of performing a Sentiment Analysis using the BERT and roBERTa algorithms to predict the emotion of a given tweet if it is Positive, Negative or Neutral. In particular, both BERT and ROBERTA will be fine tuned using the given dataset in order to improve the model overall performance.

Before feeding the data to the algorithms, during the pre-processing of the data, the tweets will be deeply cleaned such as to remove things like links, hashtags at the end of the sentences and also remove any kind of punctuation to allow the algorithms to better understand the text and improve the prediction performance.
